# Enterprise-LAN-Design-
Design Enterprise LAN
I designed and configured a Local Area Network (LAN) using Cisco Packet Tracer to simulate a real-world enterprise environment. The network consists of a single switch that support multiple VLANs to logically separate different departments within the organization. 
Each VLAN was assigned a unique subnet to enhance network performance, organization, and security by reducing broadcast domains. A single router was implemented to provide inter-VLAN communication and to enable Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) services for automatic IP address allocation to all devices within each VLAN.

This project demonstrates my practical understanding of LAN design,  subnetting, VLAN configuration, DHCP setup, and inter-VLAN routing, all essential skills for enterprise network management.
